###### Player and Computer Generated Missions
The current idea is to add player *"objectives"* or **"mission fragments"** which could then be **mixed and matched to create new player experiences**. With that, the hope is to make mixing and matching the fragments so straight-forward that it would **allow non-programmers to easily create objectives, missions and stories** on their own, or have the computer generate everything on its own. That way people will be able to get a fresh and unexpected experience every time they play.
