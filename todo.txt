Milestones
  √ player cash
  √ ship fuel
  √ gas stations with price per liter
  √ gas purchase button
  - simple mission (delivery)

Interaction:
  - fly through/shoot selection options instead of using the mouse
    (eg. accept missions by flying through an orb next to the star)
  - basic menu
      - show nearest gas station (only if known?)
      - show nearest distressed star
      - show nearest player (costs money?)

View
 - star info pane
 - mini-map with points of interest
 - tweened animation for pop-ups etc
 - clean up HUD
 - firing 'line' when ship is firing
 - damage halo when ship takes fire

Gameplay
 - star names
 √ ship fuel
 √ player cash
 √ gas stations (eg 1 in 100 stars)
    √ generating
    √ purchase fuel
 - trophies/achievements
 - upgrades for everything (gun type, fuel, cargo capacity, etc.)
 - ship distress signal (eg. when out of fuel, for fun)
 - collect bounties on fugitives (eg. attract pirates via distress signal)

Missions
  - introduction/delivery:
    origin: any start
    go to destination
    click/fly through target
    come back to origin
  - distress signal:
    respond to a star's distress signal
    possible outcomes:
      trap
      salvage
      mission option
      assist (eg. give gas)

Engine
  √ range checking for certain actions (eg. must be near star to buy fuel)
  √ add message/notification system
  - add Font object which describes fonts, color, line height, char width, etc.
  √ fix bullet-collisions
  - add more ship gears/speeds: craw, normal, fast, turbo
  - add hyperspace/jump to location option (for price)
  - add ai/bots (pirates, friendlies, roadside/spaceside)
  - add ship auto-pilot (pruchasable)
  - add a scripting language for missions
    describes star conditions, pass/fail outcomes/rewards, mission flow, etc

Player Objective
  description: string
  pass: function
  fail: function
  cleanup: function # remove event listeners
  events:
    pass: []
    fail: []

Mission System
  √ register initial event listeners
  - missions are event driven
  - missions can create sprites
  - create mission
      start requirements (min players, min)
      players

Event System
  √ register listeners
  √ emit events
  √ add timeout events
  - add event dependencies (has event occurred since I started listening? etc.)

Events
  √ timeout
  √ player:
      action (forward, left, right, brake, fire)
      death

Player Events
  - join
  - leave
  - die
  √ move
  √ no fuel
  √ re-fuel
  - no cash
  - mission success
  - mission fail
  √ timeout

Bugs
  √ life at 1000 on fuel purchase
  √ server-side fuel purchase
  √ re-associate client-side bullets with their originators (ship/gun)
  √ rejoined player not updating existing players
  √ move gas station icon above star
  √ pager sequence (refuel update in between brake strings)
  √ re-enabled bullet firing
  - dead ship doesn't disappear if their canvas is paused
  - ring buffer map overflow (try map instead of toArray in pager brake strings)
  - negative position?

Mission
  - prize
  - description
  - start location
  - conditions
    - currency
    - location
    - distance traveled
    - destination

Condition
  - event handler

Objective
  - one or more conditions combined with 'and' logic
  - waits for all conditions to be met
  - is disabled/deactivated by milestone

Milestone
  - one or more objectives combined with 'or' logic
  - two objective categories: pass or fail
  - disables/deactives all objectives in both categories when one is achieved
  - success/failure: activate milestone transition

MilestoneTransition
  - connects two milestone: previous and next
  - disables previous milestone
  - on success:
    - enacts a transition action (eg. give player some money)
    - activates the next milestone
  - on failure:
    - enacts failure action
    - enacts mission failure on transitions to some previous milestone

Mission:
  - list of milestones
  - success action (reward)
  - failure action (eg. message: you suck)

Event Driven
  - everything in the game can emit and handle events
  - the vast majority of what goes on in the game happens
      as a result of events

Ideas:
  Event Aggregators:
    Some event handlers want to execute immediately.
    Regular event handlers can wait and allow for events to be aggregated.
    Example of an immediate event handler: mouse movement handler
    Example of a regular event handler: handler to update mouse objects list
    Events can either be aggregated into one place and processed at a regular
    interval, or they can be funneled into separate 'aggregators' which
    are processed at separate intervals.
    Event aggregators will reduce processing use in the case where at least
    some regular events can be processed less frequently than other regular
    events. So, instead of having two event layers, immediate, and regular,
    we can have immediate event handling as well as a hypothetically limitless
    number of regular events being handled at varying intervals.

WIP:
  √ Keep references of all eventables in arrays in the game
  √ game.lib =
      Bullet: { id: bullet }
      Star: { id: star }
