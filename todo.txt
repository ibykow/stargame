Milestones
  √ player cash
  √ ship fuel
  √ gas stations with price per liter
  √ gas purchase button
  - simple mission (delivery)

Interaction:
  - fly through/shoot selection options instead of using the mouse
    (eg. accept missions by flying through an orb next to the star)
  - basic menu
      - show nearest gas station (only if known?)
      - show nearest distressed star
      - show nearest player (costs money?)

View
 - star info pane
 - mini-map with points of interest
 - tweened animation for pop-ups etc
 - clean up HUD

Gameplay
 - star names
 √ ship fuel

Player Objective
  description: string
  pass: function
  fail: function
  cleanup: function # remove event listeners
  events:
    pass: []
    fail: []

Mission System
  √ register initial event listeners
  - missions are event driven
  - missions can create sprites
  - create mission
      start requirements (min players, min)
      players

Event System
  √ register listeners
  √ emit events
  √ add timeout events
  - add event dependencies (has event occurred since I started listening? etc.)

Events
  √ timeout
  √ player:
      action (forward, left, right, brake, fire)
      death

Player Events
  - join
  - leave
  - die
  √ move
  √ no fuel
  √ re-fuel
  - no cash
  - mission success
  - mission fail
  √ timeout

Bugs
  √ life at 1000 on fuel purchase
  √ server-side fuel purchase
  √ re-associate client-side bullets with their originators (ship/gun)
  - dead ship doesn't disappear if their canvas is paused
  √ move gas station icon above star
  √ pager sequence (refuel update in between brake strings)
  - ring buffer map overflow (try map instead of toArray in pager brake strings)

Mission
  - prize
  - description
  - start location
  - conditions
    - currency
    - location
    - distance traveled
    - destination

Condition
  - event handler

Objective
  - one or more conditions combined with 'and' logic
  - waits for all conditions to be met
  - is disabled/deactivated by milestone

Milestone
  - one or more objectives combined with 'or' logic
  - two objective categories: pass or fail
  - disables/deactives all objectives in both categories when one is achieved
  - success/failure: activate milestone transition

MilestoneTransition
  - connects two milestone: previous and next
  - disables previous milestone
  - on success:
    - enacts a transition action (eg. give player some money)
    - activates the next milestone
  - on failure:
    - enacts failure action
    - enacts mission failure on transitions to some previous milestone

Mission:
  - list of milestones
  - success action (reward)
  - failure action (eg. message: you suck)
